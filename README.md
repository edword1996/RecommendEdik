 # Recommender Systems

# Task description
The task is to develop different types of recommendation systems, taking as a basis any mathematical solutions and algorithms, not including neural networks.
4 types of recommendation systems have been developed:
 - Demographic filtering;
 - Content_Based_Filtering;
 - k-means_recommend;
 - SVD_calloborativ.
 # Dataset 
Dataset TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset was used. Datasets are in the 'Data' folder, you need to download them.
Describe dataset:

The first dataset 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv', and it contains the following:

- overview - brief description of movie
- popularity - numeric quantity specifying movie popularity
- production_companies - the production house of movie
- production_countries - country in which movie was produced
- release_data - date of movie release
- revenue - worldwide revenue generated by movie
- runtime - running time of the movie in minutes
- status - "Released" or "Rumored"
- tagline - movie's tagline
- title - title of movie

# Demographic filtering
Before getting started with this:

- we need a metric to score or rate movie
- Calculate the score for every movie
- Sort the scores and recommend the best rated movie to the users.
